# TypeScript & Imports

## TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript.
- Avoid `any`; prefer `unknown` + narrowing.
- Export types explicitly where helpful (`export type ...`).

## Imports
- Prefer package entrypoints:
  - Good: `import { theme } from '@cynnix-studios/ui'`
  - Bad: `import { theme } from '@cynnix-studios/ui/src/theme'`
- Avoid cross-package relative imports.
- Keep `packages/*` free of app-specific imports.

## Module boundaries
- `packages/sudoku-core` must remain platform-agnostic and Node-compatible.
- `packages/ui` must stay lightweight (RN styles only; avoid heavy deps).
